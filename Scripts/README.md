#0 CHECK FOR SPECIES NAMES: I started with plant species then searched for pollinators. I just conserve the code of pollinators (it's basically the same code but plant genus instead of poll genus). 

1) CONVERT NETWORKS TO LONG FORMAT AND ADD POLL SPECIES NAMES: Now I change networks from wide format to long format and I add the pollinator species names and pollinator's guilds. 6 main groups.
